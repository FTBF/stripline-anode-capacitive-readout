1. Funnels on the ends of striplines where there is a transition to small traces. (DONE)

2. Mechanical holding system: (Added pogo pin board mounting holes)
	- Uses pogo pin board from Incom (DONE)


3. High voltage divider circuit directly on readout board
	- Study the proper coupling between supply and RF grounds. 

5. Include a surface spring mount SMA jack "tap" on two strips

6. (next iteration) Think of solutions to avoid super thick FR-4 boards. Revisit impedances and capacitances between layers. 
	- Samtec connector on one side and extend with a cable
	- Two boards that are soldered to one another to build the thickness (or second board, wraparound board, is thin traces with close gnd plane)
	- Special ground plane patterning
