1. Funnels on the ends of striplines where there is a transition to small traces. 

2. Mechanical holding system:
	- It applies spring force between PCB and anode lip of LAPPD
	- It makes the electrical connection between internal LAPPD anode and GND, either HV gnd or analog ground of readout board
	- Possible hardware is RF finger stock


3. A coupling mechanism between internal anode to GND, or HV gnd to PCB gnd, with passive component options. 
	- Possible idea: have the entire HV filter/divider on this PCB 

4. Draw a schematic for HV filtering and how the GND of this board should be connected, possibly capacitively, to the HV ground somewhere. Put in a mechanism for attaching HV gnd (shields of cables or a wire from HV filter box) to this board, possibly through passive components. 

5. Include a pad "tap" on two strips

6. Think of solutions to avoid super thick FR-4 boards. Revisit impedances and capacitances between layers.
