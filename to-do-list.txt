1. Funnels on the ends of striplines where there is a transition to small traces. 
2. Holes for mounting pogo-pin boards OR a solution that allows for a mechanical holding mechanism to reference this thick PCB. 
3. Optional grounding path for the capacitively coupled anode to the gnd planes in this board, possibly integrated with the mechanical mechanism above - but note that it should have the option of being electrically isolated from the LAPPD internal anode, as in reality this should probably just be connected to HV ground return. 
4. Draw a schematic for HV filtering and how the GND of this board should be connected, possibly capacitively, to the HV ground somewhere. Put in a mechanism for attaching HV gnd (shields of cables or a wire from HV filter box) to this board, possibly through passive components.
